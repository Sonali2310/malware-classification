# Instructions
Put learn.py and utils.py in the same place.

Usage: `python learn.py [malware_folder_path benign_folder_path [ns [num_of_files]]]`.
Optional arguments
* malware_folder_path & benign_folder_path specify the path to the folders holding the malware / benign files (.asm or .dlldisassemble) [default: malware / benign are `/media/user/New Volume/train` and `/media/user/New Volume/benign`]
* ns is the different sized ngrams that will be used to classify files (`234` will mean the program will extract 2-grams, 3-grams and 4-grams from each file) [default: `4`]
* num_of_files is how many files to use from each class [default: `100`]

Note that the malware files can be in different folders

## Calssifying .dll Files
You can use disassembly_script.py to disassemble all .dll files in a certain folder to our own serialization, .dlldisassemble.
Usage: `python disassembly_script.py [path]` where path is the path to the folder containing the .dll files (`path` default: `benign`)
